This is an Android application that allows you to control a Spykee robot (http://www.spykeeworld.com/) from your Android phone.  The phone communicates over WiFi with the robot and can send it commands to move around and play sound effects.  The Spykee robot transmits images at 320x240 resolution at 15 frames/second which are displayed on the phone.  The microphone on the robot captures 16-bit audio samples at 16KHz which is played on the phone.

For a brief demo on youtube, see this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxCS82wJ6Qs

You need to set the IP address on Spykee to a known address (something like 192.168.1.10) in your wireless router.  See the instructions included with Spykee.  Then you can connect to it using the Android phone on the same local WiFi network.

You currenty need a trackball or Dpad to move the robot.  I plan to add on-screen controls in a future version for phones that just have a touchscreen.

Audio in works (from Spykee to the phone) but audio out is currently not supported.  I plan to add that in a future version.

It also needs a pretty icon to represent the app.
